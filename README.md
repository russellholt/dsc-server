# a web server from 1995

This is a web server I wrote in C++ in early 1995.  It very likely does not work today.  I wrote it
for the startup I worked for at the time, Destiny Software Corporation.  It ran our corporate site
for a few years. I originally developed it under SunOS 4.1.3 on a sparc-2 (iirc), and later ported
it to Solaris.

The purpose of this was to make writing cgi programs easier by providing better abstraction and
structure.  The cgi abstraction I called "SURL" (for 'server url') described and implemented here
was never completed in this server because it quickly evolved into a full blown programming language
and application server in the subsequenst projects RSL and Granite Foundation (RSL 2). There, it
interacted with other web servers instead.

## this is old junk

but it's here because I wrote it. FYI.
