# a web server from 1995

This is a web server I wrote in C++ in early 1995. It very likely does not work today.  I wrote it
for the startup I worked for at the time, Destiny Software Corporation. It ran our corporate site
for a few years.

The purpose of this was to make writing cgi programs easier by providing better abstraction and
structure.  The cgi abstraction I called "SURL" (for 'server url') here would eventually morph into a
full blown programming language and application server in the subsequenst projects RSL and Granite
Foundation (RSL 2).
