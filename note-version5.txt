Notes on version 0.5 of the Destiny web server and classes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*	Version 0.5 incorporates stronger access control mechanisms - unlimited
	number of Host, IP, and user/password authentication per SURL.

*	Resources are now real classes.  httpResHandler now uses instantiated
	resources instead of internal routines for things like directory
	indexing, cgi data decoding.

*	Singly linked lists are implemented from a single template class,
	SLList, instead of having multiple individual list classes.  Now there
	is SLList<String> instead of StringSLList.

*	CGI resource class and "factory" harness for creating custom external
	cgi applications by assembling desired resources.

*	CGI-redirect: The output of external CGI processes is now connected
	to the server via a pipe instead of directly to the socket.  The
	server looks for the "Location: " directive on the first line from
	the CGI process.  If it exists, the requested URL is accessed as if
	it had been the one originally requested.  Note that this new URL
	may potentially may be another cgi request, and this could continue
	indefinitely!  Note also that the new URL must reside on the server,
	otherwise a not-found error is returned, and there is no way to tell
	on the user end *which* was not found: the CGI script, or the returned
	URL it redirected the server to.
